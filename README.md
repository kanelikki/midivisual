# A Midi Visualiser made with Godot

This is example code how to make piano.

## Limits

- Piano keys are limited, less than real piano. Might skip the too low or too high key.
- Left hand right hand play supports work so weird, but get over it D:<
- Might be hidden bug somewhere, it'll be fun to find! (Also I don't care!)
